# Theoretical model of the effective thermal conductivity of Lichtenecker
The theoretical model of the effective thermal conductivity of Lichtenecker is widely used in petrophysics to calculate
thermal conductivity (according to data on the porosity of rocks and mineral composition,
thermal conductivity of the mineral skeleton) when interpreting
experimental data on the thermal conductivity of rocks and obtaining data on
the thermal conductivity of rocks in the absence of an experiment. This model
is recommended by many researchers for solving various problems
of thermal petrophysics and geothermy.
